Tasks
-----
+ Specify sensor-network relation within framework.
    + Get snort.conf, spade.conf, ntop.conf, ossim.conf from every sensor.
    + Edit those files and set $HOME_NET to specified value.
    + Copy files back
    - Restart systems.
    + Use scp, shared dsa keys.

- Ports
    + Be able to insert new ports (not groups) from the web interface.

- Sockets
    - Snort is only able to log to unix sockets... we have to get it to log
      over the network in a fast, efficient manner. We could write to a binary
      file, read from this file and send it over to our parser.

+ Threads
    + Rewrite the parser so we can use N simultaneous tasks (we can start
      using three):
        - Listen & Parse
        - Compute
        - Insert into DB
    + Start up parser reading C & A levels from DB, maintain in memory and try
      to get rid of every single SELECT.

+ Nat
    + Include another DB field so we can specify host & network natted
      addresses.

- Alerting 
    - Specify persistence for C & A as for rrds. 
    + Set an alerting checkbox beneath every host, network, rrd.
    + Specify alerting email within conf.

+ Integrate perl scripts into parser
    + Update levels, lower levels can be done easily from parser.

- NMS asset info
    - Rewrite nms asset data so it can get the following info from our DB:     
        - Threshold_c
        - Threshold_a
        - Alert (yes/no)
        - Persistence
        - OS
        - MAC

- Installation scripts

- P0f & arpwatch
    + Modify scripts so they discard some os changes if they are too similar.
    - Let p0f watch on multiple interfaces.
    - Let arpwatch watch on multiple interfaces without IP address.

- Misc
    - Limit rrd creation to defined networks only (if undefined they grow too
      fast).
    - Watch parser.log size, rrd size. Limit it and alert if it exceeds some
      fixed value (50% of disk capacity or something like that)
    + Backup ossim databes everyday and compress.

- Hosts and Policy
    - When inserting more than 200 or 300 hosts they get to big.
    - Limit host appearance using network as order key. If a network gets
      clicked, expand host list. Contract if it gets clicked a second time.
      Don't use javascript. Allow multiple networks to get expanded.
    + Reinsert search functionality into Hosts.php
    + Host sort order -> Order by ip.
    - Be able to specify a time range of "any" to make things easier. (Sort of
      a checkbox)
    - Be able to change relative policy order so that policies are read from
      the first to the last, being the first the most important.

- Parser
    - Be able to send some sort of a signal from within the web interface so the parser knows when to reload itself.

Old
---
- Relink graph functionality
- Relink graph drawing
- Integrate graphs in parser
- Ability to sort almost everything. Reverse order sort
- Search in hosts/networks
- Control Panel ntop integration, top three hosts traffic
+ Static control panel functionality
- Rule editor
- Install script
- Horizontal / Vertical graph relocation
- Hard link analisys using ntop's "sessions"
+ Buffer parser input
+ Use time-based policy
- Up and Download rules from sensor, edit/modify/delete rule groups, restart
  sensors.
- Update snort rules automagically
- Be able to dump & restore host, network and policy
- Insert ntop anomalies into control panel
- Integrate apache abuse with control panel

+ Insert nmap into ossim.conf, correct nmap_path where needed.
+ Add META no cache on dynamic pages
+ Modify != Insert. When modifying networks they get duplicated.
+ Network order in riskmeter ? How are networks drawn ? asort doesn't seem to
  work quite well...
+ Control panel network appearance ?
+ Control panel: show only nets that are in table "net" (eq. for hosts)
+ Parser keeps dying... can't open /etc/ossim.conf. Why is configuration
  re-read everytime an alert arrives ? why is an mysql connection established
  everytime an alert arrives ? Parser rewrite...
+ Parser doesn't take policy into account.
+ Add ossim_log to ossim.conf. ossim.init.d...
+ Using "buffer" may suppose loosing alerts (they get cut in two). Use tail blocking instead.
+ Popup host graph when clicking on A or C value in control panel.
+ Control Panel. Draw numbers in red when they get too high (threshold)
+ control_panel.pl relative paths...
+ Ntop link doesn't work well with 2 "//" in frameoptions popup..
+ When modifying policy, hosts get selected twice (source/dest is not being
  taken into account)
+ Serious vulnerability when calculating networks with nmap. Sanity check !!!!
- Ntop keeps dying after ntop modifications. sigh... 4 days without diying, debug.
+ Ips aren't substitued with Hostnames in Control Panel
- Don't open a mysql connection every time you insert a fw-1 alert.
- Only get MAX|MIN|AVG rrd values for top 5 control-panel hosts.
- Use intval() to escape integers (instead of settype()). Fix SQL injection.
- Get last maxC/maxA date, and show it at control_panel.

----

- p0f is too specific. Either take some anomalies into account or disable
  verbose os printing.
- parser dies after a few days.
- Rewrite arpwatch so it can use an interface without assigned address.
- Rewrite ntop so we use rrdtool 1.1.0 again.
- Specify multiple interfaces within config. Multiple local networks.

- Much much more...
