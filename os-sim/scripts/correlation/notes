How it works:

Server fills in host_plugin_sid table with pads and p0f information.
- OS's are plugin_id 5001, type "4" (new special type :p), plugin_sid from plugin_sid table.
- Services are plugin_id 5002, plugin_sid the port number.
- Everything else works as nessus-snort:
	An event arrives, server checks plugin_reference table, if there's a matching reference_id:sid it checks host_plugin_sid table and if there's a match: **alarm**.

# Extract from snort rules
extract_corr.pl # -->
os_services.txt

# os_services.txt is the resulting "extraction", comma separated
corr_to_sql.pl # -->
os_services.sql

# parses /etc/services and fills in those that have a name. Else it uses "Port #num"
create_services_table.pl # -->
service_tables.sql

# Filled in manually. Each os needs an unique identifier
os-sim/db/plugins/ossim-os.sql
