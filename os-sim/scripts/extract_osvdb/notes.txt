"This product includes data from the Open Source Vulnerability Database developed by OSVDB (www.osvdb.org) and its contributors."

Ossim uses OSVDB data to do some cross-correlation. If you want to update the data between OSVDB id's and snort id's, you must follow this simple steps:

1.- Download the OSVDB XML file. Please go to www.osvdb.org and accept the Agreement. After that, do:

# wget http://osvdb.org/exports/xmlDumpByID-Current.xml.bz2
# bunzip2 xmlDumpByID-Current.xml.bz2

2.- extract all the snort rules with cve or bugtraq associations:

dmz:/etc/snort/rules# cat *.rules |grep bugtraq > a.txt
dmz:/etc/snort/rules# cat *.rules |grep cve >> a.txt

3.- extract the CVE and Bugtraq numbers associated with each sid:
# ./extract_cve_bugtraq.pl a.txt > b.txt

4.- Do the relationship between CVE and Bugtraq numbers, and its OSVDB entry:
# ./get_cve_bgtrck3.pl b.txt xmlDumpByID-2007-02-28.xml > c.txt

5.- Remove duplicated lines:
# sort c.txt |uniq > snort_osvdb.sql

6.- Insert data into ddbb

# mysql -p ossim < snort_osvdb.sql
