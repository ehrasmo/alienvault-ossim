We want to get the OS from the OSVDB database, wich has some relation with snort data.

NOTE: If you extracted in the upper directory the snort<->osvdb relationships, you can jump over steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, and go directly to step 4. If not, please start in step 1

1.- Download the OSVDB XML file. Please go to www.osvdb.org and accept the Agreement. After that, do:

# wget http://osvdb.org/exports/xmlDumpByID-Current.xml.bz2
#bunzip2 xmlDumpByID-Current.xml.bz2

2.- extract all the snort rules with cve or bugtraq associations:

dmz:/etc/snort/rules# cat *.rules |grep bugtraq > a.txt
dmz:/etc/snort/rules# cat *.rules |grep cve >> a.txt

3.- extract the CVE and Bugtraq numbers associated with each sid:
# ./extract_cve_bugtraq.pl a.txt > b.txt

4.- Do the relationship between CVE and Bugtraq numbers, and its OSVDB entry:
# ./get_cve_bgtrck3.pl b.txt xmlDumpByID-2007-02-28.xml > c.txt

5.- Put in a list just the "snort , osvdb_id);" to extract more comfortable from the next script: 
# cut -d,  -f5,7 c.txt > f.txt

6.- Get the relationships. executing wrapper_get_OSVDB.sh will execute get_OS_OSVDB.pl. You need to change the password inside wrapper_get_OSVDB.sh
    to access DB:

# ./wrapper_get_OSVDB.sh > OS_plugin_reference.sql

7.- Remove duplicated lines:
# cat plugin_reference.sql | sort | uniq > OS_plugin_reference_single.sql

8.- Insert it into ossim database

# mysql -p ossim < OS_plugin_reference_single.sql


Now you have Relationships between snort events, and OS listed into base_name osvdb table :)
