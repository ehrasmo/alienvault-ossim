Frequently Asqued Questions
---------------------------

This archive is growing 'cause of people who take the time to ask questions.
At this time I'm the only maintainer so please direct questions at me: dk@ossim.net.

I like this phrase, I don't know which language it belongs to:
----------------
If you ask a question you may seem dumb. If you don't ask you'll stay dumb for
the rest of your life.

So, many thanks to: EOF().

Q: Why arent't anomalies being drawn ?
A: Wait about 24-36H before the system knows what's normal.

Q: draw_graph.pl doesn't do anything. What's happening ?
A: Make sure font path is working, draw_graph.pl is placed in /cgi-bin/, has
execute permission and you have an experimental rrd version running (>=1.1.0).
You have to patch mrtg using $ossim_home/contrib/mrtg/mrtg.diff first in order
to get everything working.

Q: I did patch mrtg but draw_graph.pl says: ERROR while generating graffic: the RRD does not contain an RRA matching the chosen CF
A: Patch mrtg first, delete all the rrds created by ossim and rerun launch_mrtg. Your mrtg doesn't know about aberrant behaviour.

Q: RRD anomaly detection doesn't work. Why ?
A: Patch ntop, enable rrd plugin, enable host rrd drawing (but limit it to what you want). Specify the correct path and wait.
A2: RRD graph syntax has changed. If you get an error message stating there
are too few arguments to the function call, just add an extra "NULL" as an additional arg.
A3: As of today (2004-03-03) the only patched ntop version known to work 100% is
2.2.c. Use rrdPlugin.c from $ossim_home/contrib/ntop/

Q: and what's the function of backlog in ossim? is the backlog the correlated
alert?  but why has it a struct type of "directive"?
A: Follows...

The main correlation datatypes are backlog and directive. Each directive is
composed of rules forming and n-ary tree as described here:

http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-N-ary-Trees.html

Then, the directives are joined together within the backlog as a linked list
waiting for one of the trigger rules to match.

Whe the first rule of a directive matches the complete directive is copied
(cloned)
into the backlog waiting for the following events to match in order to advance
through the tree.

Multiple directives can be matched with a single rule within the backlog. The
matching directives are copied into ossim db, (backlog and alert tables), 
in order to be used from within the web frontend.

In order to resume.
- struct backlog is an n-ary tree.
- The backlog holds the currently matched directives.
- The backlog isn't the correlated alert but the directive being correlated.
Once the directive fully matches or times out, it's cleaned from the backlog.
- The backlog entry has a struct type of directive because it's really a cloned
  directive.

Q: Ntop rrd graphs are being drawn but don't show any labels.
A: Patch rrdtool sources and make $rrdtool_source_home/src/rrd_graph.c:36
(2003-09) point at a valid ttf font. Relink ntop.

Q: Trying to show directives: Directives editor Fatal error: Call to undefined function: domxml_open_file() 
A: Please add php4-domxml

Q: What's all that aberrant behaviour stuff ?
A: Please take a look at (many thank's to all of them):

Q: Agent says: ImportError: No module named _mysql
A: Please import python-mysql from sourceforge into your dist.
